Script that uses byid to connect to radio eliminating the need for udev rules
The specific information you need will be from your /dev/serial/by-id file to fill in what is different than myu yeasu prodcut,  this will be the part that needs to change most likley "AH057M5G080385"
This will work with all silicon-labs dual ports on yeasu radios, 
See my work on the ic705 for icoms
